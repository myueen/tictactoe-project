# TicTacToe

This project is intended to create a TicTacToe game using Java. TicTacToe game is popular worldwide with its simple rule. Two players each choose one of the two symbols (usually "X" and "O") to represent its side in a gameboard made of nine grids. Each round one player put down one's symbol on one of the grid. The game continues until one player wins. A win happens when one player successfully has the same symbol line up horizontally, vertally or on the two diagnoal lines. 

The project is not intended to create a TicTacToe game for human versus computer, but a game for two people to play continously on a screen without the need to write new grids on pieces of paper. 

With that in mind, the following records the process and procedures of how this game come into being on the screen using Java. 

(1) Design of Game Board
    * Since the TicTacToe game board is in the form of a matrix with rows and columns. A 2D array of character is used to design the board so that presnts a grid consisting of nine squares on the screen. Instead of simply an array or arraylist data structure, a 2D array allows to make rows and columns easily.
